# Go Chip16

This is a chip16 emulator written in Golang.

This project is still at an early stage, moving forward in steady, small steps. I'm planning on
using [pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel) for graphics and
[beep](https://github.com/faiface/beep) for sound.

The full chip16 specification can be found [here](https://github.com/chip16/chip16/wiki).
